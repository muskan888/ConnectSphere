AGILE METHODOLOGY: SCRUM METHODOLOGY
PRODUCT BACKLOG
1. Front-End: Initially, I planned the structure of frontend of Microsoft Team’s clone.
I decided to implement it a bit differently than the current teams.

2. Video calling: As the initial requirement was to build system where at least 2 people can connect.
   It included building,testing,planning and revealing.

3. Screen sharing & Whiteboard: As screen sharing is mandatory for almost all the meetings.
  I decided to build that.White board can be used as an easy way to take notes/present pictorial data.

4.  Chat: Earlier, I decided to build chat which does not gets saved and only takes place during the video call.
   After the ‘adapt’ feature was revealed, I built chat which gets saved an can occur before/after meetings
